## How it works

Takes a 4-bit Gray code input and converts it into a 4-bit Binary code output.
The most significant bit (MSB) of the Binary code is the same as the Gray code MSB.
Each subsequent Binary bit is generated by performing XOR between the previous Binary bit and the current Gray bit.

## How to test
Provide a 4-bit Gray code input through switches or in the testbench.

Observe the 4-bit Binary output on LEDs, a 7-segment display, or in simulation.

Verify correctness using the Gray-to-Binary truth table (e.g., Gray = 0101 â†’ Binary = 0111).

Run multiple test cases to ensure correct conversion.
